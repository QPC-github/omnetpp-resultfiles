How to plot a vector

How to plot several vectors, with a good legend (e.g. configName + runNumber + moduleName + vectorName)

How to compute and plot a histogram of a vector

How to plot a histogram together with its cumulative distribution function

How to put several histograms on a single plot (like in the IDE)
(do second and further plots with add=TRUE)

How to transform a dataset into another dataset where all scalars are averaged across replications?
How to compute confidence intervals as well?

How to create a bar chart of some scalars where error bars indicate confidence interval?

How to average some scalars across modules? (e.g. "avgQueueLength" across modules that
fit a certain pattern, i.e. "**.queue*")
(e.g. one can use SQL, for example "module like '%.queue%'")

How to compute the mean, stddev, min, max etc of vectors (is it possible without loading the vectors into memory as R vectors?)

How to plot a scatter chart where the X axis is some run iteration variable (i.e. $numHosts)
(itervars are saved as module pars as well, they can be used too)

How to plot a 3D chart where the X,Y axes are run iteration variables (i.e. $numHosts, $transmitPower)
