Technical notes:

BUILDING:

  The R source package can be built from the working copy with the 
  "R CMD build --no-resave-data R-package" command. To build a binary package, 
   use "R CMD build --binary --no-resave-data R-package" command.

  NOTE: When working on Windows, the same command will work, but the Rtools package 
  needs to be installed and all its bin/ dirs (bin/, perl/bin, MinGW/bin) as
  well as R/bin dir should be in the PATH.

  The working copy MUST be checked out with LF line endings (otherwise the vci
  files for sample vec files will be invalid!). To ensure that, set 
  "core.autocrlf=false" in the git repo (then make sure takes effect by
  deleting the working copy and checking it out again)

INSTALLATION:

  $ R CMD INSTALL omnetpp_0.7-1.tar.gz

  NOTE: You may need to install the 'reshape' package before installing omnetpp.
  > install.packages("reshape")

INSTALLING from CRAN:
  > install.packages("omnetpp")
