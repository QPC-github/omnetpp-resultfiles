ResultWriter
============

This is a C++ library for recording OMNeT++ result files. The library also
includes a small working simulation (Aloha) to demonstrate the use of the
library. The code is deliberately kept simple to facilitate understanding.

The library can be built into your own Java-based simulations. The benefit
is that you'll be able to use the OMNeT++ IDE Analysis tool for interactively 
browsing and plotting the results, and GNU R (with the use of the OMNeT++ R 
extension) for scripting the processing and plot generation.
